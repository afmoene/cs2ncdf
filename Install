Installation hints for csi2ncdf

Binary
------
The release contains a DOS-executable of csi2ncdf, which was compiled
with DJGPP (with gcc 2.95.2). It will work perfectly well
in a DOS-box on Win95 and Win98 machines (and maybe 'higher' Windows
as well, though not tested).

Source
------
In order to compile csi2ncdf yourself, you will need the NetCDF library
(libnetcdf.a) and the header files (notably netcdf.h). The source of 
the NetCDF library can be obtained from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf . Compilation should be more or less painless on a wide variety
of Unices. Precompiled libraries for the Mac are available (see
the FAQ at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/faq.html)

In order to compile and link csi2ncdf you might need to tweak the makefile to
reflect the location of header files and library. Compilation has
been tested on Win95 (with DJGPP and Mingw32), Linux and HP-UX, but
should work on any UNIX flavour. Install the executable csi2ncdf wherever
you like, as long as it is in your path.
