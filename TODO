Todo list for csi2ncdf.

Apparent bug:
* input ASCII file without ArrayID. -b condition does not work if fake arrayID in configuration file is set to 0 (zero). A -c condition *does* work.
* when using text input (from TOB1 output) with stop condition: reading does not stop (Bram)

Todo:
* if decoding of text fails for a certain number store the MISSING_VALUE value, rather than 0 or NaN
* make the extra time coordinate (constructed with time_mult) a double, rather then a float.
