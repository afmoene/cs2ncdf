Changelog for csi2ncdf

Version 2.2.2: 2002-10-4 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* added code ensure that data of different columns remain in sync
  (relevant when data file is corrupt -> in caseyou need the -s sloppy flag). 
  Although it should go correctly now,
  there is a check that stops the program when the data are not in sync 
  which implies there is a bug).
* the missing_value switch in the format file now results in an attribute
  named _FillValue that contains this missing value. This is the standard
  naming used in NetCDF. Besides, the attribute with this name is
  actually used by the NetCDF library.
Version 2.2.1: 2002-9-26 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed bug: in some cases where sloppy switch was needed, value
  of a variable from the last correct column was copied to the 
  output array every time an invalid byte was encountered. This affected
  only files that were processed with sloppy flag or 
  which gave messages about 'Dummy word found'.
Version 2.2 : 2002-9-26  (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* now can read data also from text files, even if they're not structured as
  the binary CSI files (the array ID is relevant here). Then use the
  -a switch. So I added support for general text files (without ArrayID)
* fixed a quirck in do_conv_csi; before it was so that if the
  read action from the binary file would give zero bytes, the routine
  would be exited directly, without writing remaining data.
* fixed weakness in reading of format file: no longer crash if
  string has no closing quote (just ignore it)

Version 2.1.2 : 2001-5-14 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* slight changes to error messages in csi2ncdf.c and ncdef.h
* added part on error messages to documentation

Version 2.1.1 : 2000-5-10 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* First public release.
