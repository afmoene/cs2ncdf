Changelog for csi2ncdf
Version 2.2.29: 2008-04-03 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* Now fill data from ASCII that are not correctly read to the right missing
value code
* Missing values codes were not correctly communicated to data with an extra
coordinate (fixed)
* To fix the previous, I also introduced a reverse lookup table to link
columns in input data to variable definitions in output
Version 2.2.28: 2008-04-02 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* If conversion of number from TOA5 fails, NaN is written to stdout
* All text output to stdout now has 10 decimal places by default (set by
TXT_DECIMALPLACES in csi2ncdf.c)
Version 2.2.27: 2008-04-02 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed problems with checks on strlen of NULL string
* composit time variable now is NC_DOUBLE
* if conversion from text to number failed, missing value code is written to
data
* if no missing value code is given, the default NetCDF fill values are used
Version 2.2.26: 2008-04-08 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* moved initialization of numcoldef (gave segfault when listing data)
Version 2.2.25: 2007-08-31 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed bug in handling of follow_id in combination with start condition: if
data not wanted because condition not valid, data were not discarded in the
correct way.
* set optimization in Makefile to -O
Version 2.2.24: 2007-08-27 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed small error in warning message when indideces are reset under sloppy
flag when more than one file is processed
* fixed handling of follow_id (and i_am_time): they relied on data starting in
column number 1, but now that is column 2 (at least for Campbell bindary).
* fixed small error in formatting of error message "unkown byte pair"
Version 2.2.23: 2007-07-18 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* processing more than one file should now also for corrupt files that survive
the sloppy switch
Version 2.2.22: 2007-07-17 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* now also conditions work on input from multiple files (including CSI binary)
* fixed bug decision to continue reading or not (caused me a seg fault, why did nobody have this problem before?)
Version 2.2.21: 2007-07-16 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed error in writing TOB1 data: it was not checked whether actually
anything was read, but still output was produced (resulting in garbage at last
line)
* implemented reading from more than one input file
Version 2.2.20: 2007-06-03 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed small error regarding converion of time in TOB1 file (unsigned longs
which were not part of time columns were not printed)
Version 2.2.19: 2007-06-01 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* added option -y to convert the optional time information in the first
columns of a TOB1 file to YYYY DOY HHMM SS.SSS information
Version 2.2.18: 2007-01-15 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* Fixed bug in reading of old-fashioned Campbell binary files (introduced in
version 2.2.16)
Version 2.2.17: 2007-01-11 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* Fixed a bug in creation of time from TOB2/3 timestamp
Version 2.2.16: 2006-11-09 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* Fixed bug in reading from textfile (now check if any data on line) 
Version 2.2.15: 2006-11-08 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* Fixed bug in TOA5 conversion
Version 2.2.14: 2006-10-04 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* implemented support for TOA5 (similar to that for TOB files)
* did some internal clean up + update of documentation
* added option to skip lines in input text file
Version 2.2.13: 2006-08-28 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* implemented support for TOB2 and TOB3 (similar to that for TOB1)
* internally type FTYPE_NEWTOB1 was renamed to FTYPE_TOB1 (since it is not
that new anymore)
* Support for IEEE4L (little endian) and IEEE4B (big endian)
Version 2.2.12: 2005-04-20 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* NB: there were a number of different versions 2.2.11 floating around on the
webserver. Sorry for the confusion
* Now *really* fixed the problem with text files (this was already fixed by
March 24, but not released through the website, only internally.)
* TOB1 now also may contain floats of type IEEE4L, which appears to be
identical to IEEE4
Version 2.2.11: 2005-03-23 (arnold.moeen@wur.nl)
* added logic to take care of textfiles with no array-id  (switch -a) in first column and
data that are needed from the first column (before we only could get data
starting from column 2, since column 1 was implicitly assumed to be filled
with array-id. But if column 1 contains arrayID it still works (data start in
column 2).
* fixed bug in parsing of text lines: missed the last column
Version 2.2.10: 2004-11-25 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* now can read input from standard input as well (making pipes possible)
* implemented listing of TOB1 data for less than the entire file possible
* increased MAXCOL to 256 (but better, dynamic allocation should be used, not
yet implemented).
* converted members of struct columndef (values and follow_val) to double, as
well as value variable in do_conv_csi; also changes in cond_number and
conv_hourmin related to float -> double
* fixed error that one column too many was written to standard output when
reading from a a text file.
* fixed error in txtdecode that would give extra column at end (trying to
decode the newline character as well).
* Got rid of empty line written to stdout when listing data to stdout
* Now listing data, read from a text file, with a faked ArrayID (switch -a) 
works correctly.
Version 2.2.9: 2004-08-30 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed some errors that caused cross-compilation for windows to fail
Version 2.2.8: 2004-06-30 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed bug in case a binary csi-file starts with an incomplete line and
  the user wants printout to the screen (e.g. -l 10). The storage string for
  the line to be printed was not initialized if starting halfway a line. Fixed
  now.
Version 2.2.7: 2003-12-16 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* added minimal support for TOB1 files (only writing to stdout
* when writing to stdout one can choose which columns should be written
 (tested for TOB1 but should also work with 'old' CSI-files)
Version 2.2.6: 2003-09-25 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* changed message when dummy word is found: one mention + line that states the
  number of repetitions.
Version 2.2.5: 2002-11-18 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* improved (= debugged) string handling in ncdef.h. Errors therein
  were the most probable cause of crashes on Windows XP (I hope)
Version 2.2.4: 2002-10-29 (arnold.moene@wur.nl
* conversion of text file to NetCDF did not produce data in file (just 
  header): fixed.
Version 2.2.3: 2002-10-8 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* moved writing of data to NetCDF file to one place, after the check
  that a new line has started. Without this the arrays that hold the data
  could be full at different moments, for different variables leading
  to non-synchronized arrays. Lead to crash on corrupt files with
  -s on.
Version 2.2.2: 2002-10-4 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* added code ensure that data of different columns remain in sync
  (relevant when data file is corrupt -> in caseyou need the -s sloppy flag). 
  Although it should go correctly now,
  there is a check that stops the program when the data are not in sync 
  which implies there is a bug).
* the missing_value switch in the format file now results in an attribute
  named _FillValue that contains this missing value. This is the standard
  naming used in NetCDF. Besides, the attribute with this name is
  actually used by the NetCDF library.
Version 2.2.1: 2002-9-26 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed bug: in some cases where sloppy switch was needed, value
  of a variable from the last correct column was copied to the 
  output array every time an invalid byte was encountered. This affected
  only files that were processed with sloppy flag or 
  which gave messages about 'Dummy word found'.
Version 2.2 : 2002-9-26  (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* now can read data also from text files, even if they're not structured as
  the binary CSI files (the array ID is relevant here). Then use the
  -a switch. So I added support for general text files (without ArrayID)
* fixed a quirck in do_conv_csi; before it was so that if the
  read action from the binary file would give zero bytes, the routine
  would be exited directly, without writing remaining data.
* fixed weakness in reading of format file: no longer crash if
  string has no closing quote (just ignore it)

Version 2.1.2 : 2001-5-14 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* slight changes to error messages in csi2ncdf.c and ncdef.h
* added part on error messages to documentation

Version 2.1.1 : 2000-5-10 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* First public release.
