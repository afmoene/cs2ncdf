Changelog for csi2ncdf
Version 2.2.10: 2004-11-25 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* now can read input from standard input as well (making pipes possible)
* implemented listing of TOB1 data for less than the entire file possible
* increased MAXCOL to 256 (but better, dynamic allocation should be used, not
yet implemented).
* converted members of struct columndef (values and follow_val) to double, as
well as value variable in do_conv_csi; also changes in cond_number and
conv_hourmin related to float -> double
* fixed error that one column too many was written to standard output when
reading from a a text file.
* fixed error in txtdecode that would give extra column at end (trying to
decode the newline character as well).
* Got rid of empty line written to stdout when listing data to stdout
* Now listing data, read from a text file, with a faked ArrayID (switch -a) 
works correctly.
Version 2.2.9: 2004-08-30 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed some errors that caused cross-compilation for windows to fail
Version 2.2.8: 2004-06-30 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed bug in case a binary csi-file starts with an incomplete line and
  the user wants printout to the screen (e.g. -l 10). The storage string for
  the line to be printed was not initialized if starting halfway a line. Fixed
  now.
Version 2.2.7: 2003-12-16 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* added minimal support for TOB1 files (only writing to stdout
* when writing to stdout one can choose which columns should be written
 (tested for TOB1 but should also work with 'old' CSI-files)
Version 2.2.6: 2003-09-25 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* changed message when dummy word is found: one mention + line that states the
  number of repetitions.
Version 2.2.5: 2002-11-18 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* improved (= debugged) string handling in ncdef.h. Errors therein
  were the most probable cause of crashes on Windows XP (I hope)
Version 2.2.4: 2002-10-29 (arnold.moene@wur.nl
* conversion of text file to NetCDF did not produce data in file (just 
  header): fixed.
Version 2.2.3: 2002-10-8 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* moved writing of data to NetCDF file to one place, after the check
  that a new line has started. Without this the arrays that hold the data
  could be full at different moments, for different variables leading
  to non-synchronized arrays. Lead to crash on corrupt files with
  -s on.
Version 2.2.2: 2002-10-4 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* added code ensure that data of different columns remain in sync
  (relevant when data file is corrupt -> in caseyou need the -s sloppy flag). 
  Although it should go correctly now,
  there is a check that stops the program when the data are not in sync 
  which implies there is a bug).
* the missing_value switch in the format file now results in an attribute
  named _FillValue that contains this missing value. This is the standard
  naming used in NetCDF. Besides, the attribute with this name is
  actually used by the NetCDF library.
Version 2.2.1: 2002-9-26 (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* fixed bug: in some cases where sloppy switch was needed, value
  of a variable from the last correct column was copied to the 
  output array every time an invalid byte was encountered. This affected
  only files that were processed with sloppy flag or 
  which gave messages about 'Dummy word found'.
Version 2.2 : 2002-9-26  (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* now can read data also from text files, even if they're not structured as
  the binary CSI files (the array ID is relevant here). Then use the
  -a switch. So I added support for general text files (without ArrayID)
* fixed a quirck in do_conv_csi; before it was so that if the
  read action from the binary file would give zero bytes, the routine
  would be exited directly, without writing remaining data.
* fixed weakness in reading of format file: no longer crash if
  string has no closing quote (just ignore it)

Version 2.1.2 : 2001-5-14 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* slight changes to error messages in csi2ncdf.c and ncdef.h
* added part on error messages to documentation

Version 2.1.1 : 2000-5-10 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* First public release.
