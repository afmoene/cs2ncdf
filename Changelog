Changelog for csi2ncdf

Version 2.2 : 2002-9-26  (arnold.moene@wur.nl)
* now can read data also from text files, even if they're not structured as
  the binary CSI files (the array ID is relevant here). Then use the
  -a switch. So I added support for general text files (without ArrayID)
* fixed a quirck in do_conv_csi; before it was so that if the
  read action from the binary file would give zero bytes, the routine
  would be exited directly, without writing remaining data.
* fixed weakness in reading of format file: no longer crash if
  string has no closing quote (just ignore it)

Version 2.1.2 : 2001-5-14 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* slight changes to error messages in csi2ncdf.c and ncdef.h
* added part on error messages to documentation

Version 2.1.1 : 2000-5-10 (arnold.moene@user.metair.wau.nl)
* First public release.
